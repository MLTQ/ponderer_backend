# mod.rs

## Purpose
Coordinates the core autonomous agent loop with explicit three-loop architecture (Ambient/Engaged/Dream): polling skills, reasoning over events, managing visual state, running periodic ambient maintenance, handling private operator chat, and persisting long-lived behavior through the shared database. It is the runtime orchestrator that binds skills, tools, reasoning, memory, and UI events.

## Components

### `Agent`
- **Does**: Owns runtime dependencies (skills, tools, config, database, reasoning engines) plus per-conversation background-subtask handles, and exposes lifecycle operations (`new`, `run_loop`, `reload_config`, `toggle_pause`, `set_paused`, `runtime_status`)
- **Interacts with**: `config::AgentConfig`, `database::AgentDatabase`, `skills::*`, `tools::ToolRegistry`, `agent::reasoning`, `agent::trajectory`, `agent::orientation`, `agent::journal`, `agent::concerns`

### Living Loop foundation modules (`journal`, `concerns`)
- **Does**: Provide typed records for journal entries and concern tracking used by new ll.1 database tables
- **Interacts with**: `database.rs` CRUD/persistence methods; future ambient/orientation loop work

### `AgentState`
- **Does**: Tracks in-memory runtime state (visual mode, pause flag, rate counters, processed event IDs)
- **Interacts with**: `run_loop`, `run_cycle`, and UI-facing event emission

### `AgentEvent` / `AgentVisualState`
- **Does**: Defines UI/event bus payloads describing current state, observations, reasoning traces, actions, orientation updates, journal writes, concern lifecycle updates, and errors
- **Interacts with**: `ui::app` via shared flume channel

### `run_loop`
- **Does**: Main background loop; checks pause/rate limits, then executes either legacy single-loop mode or phase-5 three-loop mode (`run_engaged_tick`, `run_ambient_tick`, `run_dream_cycle`) depending on config
- **Interacts with**: `maybe_evolve_persona`, `run_engaged_tick`, `run_ambient_tick`, `should_dream`, `run_dream_cycle`, `run_cycle`

### `run_engaged_tick`
- **Does**: Runs operator chat processing and skill-event handling as the engaged loop, returning the filtered skill events used as ambient context input
- **Interacts with**: `process_chat_messages`, skill polling, `AgenticLoop` skill-event pass

### `run_ambient_tick`
- **Does**: Runs orientation + disposition execution + optional concern decay + merged heartbeat scheduling in the ambient loop
- **Interacts with**: `maybe_update_orientation`, `execute_disposition`, `maybe_run_heartbeat`, `ConcernsManager`

### `maybe_run_heartbeat`
- **Does**: Schedules autonomous heartbeat cycles, reads pending checklist/reminder signals, and invokes the tool-calling loop only when work exists
- **Interacts with**: `tools::agentic::AgenticLoop`, `ToolRegistry`, `AgentDatabase::agent_state` and working memory

### `maybe_run_memory_evolution`
- **Does**: Runs periodic replay evaluation for memory backends, stores eval artifacts, and records promotion-policy outcomes
- **Interacts with**: `memory::eval`, `memory::archive`, `AgentDatabase` memory eval/promotion APIs

### `run_cycle`
- **Does**: Polls skills, filters new events, then runs a dedicated agentic pass over those events so tool calls (including bridged skill actions) happen in the same loop architecture as private chat
- **Interacts with**: `Skill::poll`, `tools::agentic::AgenticLoop`, `ToolRegistry` (notably `graphchan_skill`), `AgentDatabase` memory/chat helpers

### `maybe_update_orientation`
- **Does**: Samples presence + context, optionally captures/evaluates a desktop screenshot (when screen-capture opt-in is enabled), injects recent action digest + previous OODA packet context, computes a coarse signature, skips redundant orientation calls when unchanged, and otherwise runs orientation synthesis and persists snapshot records
- **Interacts with**: `presence/mod.rs` (`PresenceMonitor`), `tools/vision.rs` (`capture_screen_to_path`), `llm_client.rs` (`evaluate_image`), `agent/orientation.rs` (`OrientationEngine`, `OrientationContext`), `database.rs` (`save_orientation_snapshot`), `AgentEvent::OrientationUpdate`
- **Rationale**: Adds situational awareness without changing existing action behavior in phase 2

### `maybe_write_journal_entry`
- **Does**: Applies journal gating (disposition + unchanged-disposition + minimum interval), requests a private entry from `JournalEngine`, persists it, and emits `JournalWritten`
- **Interacts with**: `agent/journal.rs` (`JournalEngine`, `journal_skip_reason`), `database.rs` (`add_journal_entry`, `set_state`)
- **Rationale**: Keeps journaling autonomous but bounded so ambient cycles do not spam repetitive entries

### `maybe_decay_concerns` / `apply_chat_concern_updates`
- **Does**: Applies salience decay each cycle (`7d -> monitoring`, `30d -> background`, `90d -> dormant`) and updates concerns from private-chat interactions via mention touch + structured concern signals
- **Interacts with**: `agent/concerns.rs` (`ConcernsManager`, `ConcernSignal`) and `database.rs` concern persistence
- **Rationale**: Keeps long-lived concern memory fresh without spamming low-value updates

### `process_chat_messages`
- **Does**: Handles unread operator chat messages by conversation thread, streams live token output during each LLM call, emits per-tool progress updates, ingests structured concern signals (`[concerns]...[/concerns]`), and can run multiple autonomous turns per thread before final handoff using a structured `[turn_control]...[/turn_control]` protocol. Foreground turn caps are optional safety rails; if enabled and exhausted while work can still continue, it offloads to a detached background subtask. It also runs deterministic loop-heat detection on per-turn signatures (action + response + tool set), forces a loop-break yield when repetitive similarity heat reaches configured threshold, persists per-turn user+system prompt payloads for UI inspection, and stores a structured OODA packet per completed autonomous turn.
- **Interacts with**: `database::chat_messages`, `database::chat_conversations`, `database::chat_turns`, `database::chat_turn_tool_calls`, `tools::agentic::AgenticLoop::run_with_history_streaming_and_tool_events`, `ToolRegistry`
- **Rationale**: Uses continuation hints (not synthetic operator messages) for multi-turn autonomy, scopes private-chat tools away from Graphchan posting, compacts long sessions through persisted summary snapshots, and only persists yielded assistant replies while allowing long tasks to continue asynchronously.

### `spawn_background_subtask` / `run_background_chat_subtask` / `reap_finished_background_subtasks`
- **Does**: Starts one detached private-chat worker per conversation, keeps subtask uniqueness per thread, executes additional autonomous turns with the same capability profile/prompt format, and reports completion/failure back through `AgentEvent`s.
- **Interacts with**: `tools::agentic::AgenticLoop`, `database::AgentDatabase` turn lifecycle APIs, `ui::app` live progress drawer via `ToolCallProgress` and `ChatStreaming`
- **Rationale**: Prevents long agentic runs from blocking the engaged loop while preserving visibility into ongoing background execution.

### `capability_profiles`
- **Does**: Resolves explicit loop capability policies (`private_chat`, `skill_events`, `heartbeat`) into per-loop `ToolContext` objects with autonomous mode and allow/deny tool lists
- **Interacts with**: `config::AgentConfig.capability_profiles`, `tools::ToolContext`

### Persona evolution helpers
- **Does**: Capture persona snapshots and run trajectory inference on schedule
- **Interacts with**: `agent::trajectory`, `database::persona_history`, reflection timestamps in `agent_state`

### `calculate_tick_duration` / `should_dream` / `run_dream_cycle`
- **Does**: Computes adaptive ambient tick frequency from user-state estimate, decides dream-trigger windows (away/deep-night + interval gate), and runs dream-cycle consolidation (trajectory check, journal digest, concern pruning)
- **Interacts with**: `presence/mod.rs`, `orientation.rs`, `database.rs` state keys and working memory

### Chat formatting helpers
- **Does**: Builds operator-chat prompts and serializes tool-call/thinking/media metadata into `[tool_calls]...[/tool_calls]`, `[thinking]...[/thinking]`, and `[media]...[/media]` blocks for inline UI rendering
- **Interacts with**: `ui/chat.rs` parser for collapsible tool details and media previews

| Dependent | Expects | Breaking changes |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `main.rs` | `Agent::new(...).run_loop()` drives autonomous behavior without extra orchestration | Changing constructor or loop entrypoint signatures |

## Notes
- Current behavior combines periodic skill polling with persona maintenance, optional heartbeat automation, and private chat handling.
- Skill-event handling now goes through the same multi-step tool-calling loop used by private chat, so skill actions and regular tools share one decision engine.
- Private chat replies are now scoped per conversation ID to avoid cross-thread prompt contamination.
- Long-running private chats are compacted as `summary snapshot + recent context + new messages`, with snapshots stored in DB and refreshed after configurable message deltas.
- Compaction summaries now include a bounded `Recent Reasoning Digest` synthesized from compacted-window OODA packets so older Observe/Orient/Decide/Act continuity survives transcript compression.
- Private chat emits a structured turn-control block per assistant response; continuation is model-driven (`decision=continue` + no user input needed), with optional turn caps acting only as safety rails.
- Private chat continuation now also requires meaningful forward progress signals (`tool_count > 0` or `status=still_working`) before another autonomous turn is allowed.
- When private-chat continuation is still justified at the turn cap, work is handed off to a per-conversation background subtask runner instead of forcing an immediate stop.
- Foreground and background autonomous chat turns now maintain a deterministic loop-heat counter from signature similarity (response text + turn-control action + tool set). When heat crosses configured threshold, continuation/offload is blocked and the agent yields with a loop-break message.
- Agentic tool-loop iteration limits are now settings-driven (`max_tool_iterations` with optional unbounded mode) instead of hardcoded per loop invocation.
- Private-chat autonomous turn limits are settings-driven for both foreground (`max_chat_autonomous_turns`) and detached background subtasks (`max_background_subtask_turns`), and each limit can be disabled so continuation is driven solely by model turn-control decisions.
- Turn-control parsing treats visible assistant text as authoritative; block `user_message` is only fallback when visible text is empty and does not resemble a hallucinated `User:`/`Operator:` transcript.
- Turn-control parsing tolerates malformed metadata envelopes (`[turn_control]` without closing marker) and fenced JSON payloads so continuation decisions remain stable across provider quirks.
- Private-chat prompts now include concern-priority context ahead of general working memory to bias retrieval toward ongoing topics.
- Private-chat prompts now include an explicit OODA section (`Observe`, `Orient`, `Decide`) sourced from latest orientation + continuation context before action generation, plus optional `Recent Action Digest` and `Previous OODA Packet` sections.
- Completed autonomous turns now persist an OODA packet (`observe`, `orient`, `decide`, `act`) so subsequent turns and orientation refresh can consume structured turn-history context instead of raw transcript only.
- Concern lifecycle now runs in-loop: decay demotes stale concerns, mention matching reactivates them, and structured concern signals create/touch concerns explicitly.
- Ambient mode merges heartbeat scheduling into ambient ticks instead of a separate pre-cycle call.
- Dream mode is gated by inactivity/time-of-day and minimum interval, then consolidates journal/context into working memory.
- Tool-call progress is streamed as events during a turn so the UI can show real-time execution output (for example shell output snippets) before final reply persistence.
- Background subtasks reuse the same streaming callbacks, so detached turns still surface incremental tool output and token streaming in activity/chat panes.
- Each autonomous private-chat turn is persisted in DB before/after execution, including tool-call lineage and terminal state (`completed`, `awaiting_approval`, or `failed`), but only the final yielded assistant message is added to chat history.
- Orientation is now refreshed once per cycle as a log-only signal: it emits `OrientationUpdate`, persists `orientation_snapshots`, and uses an input signature cache to avoid repeated LLM calls when context is unchanged.
- When `enable_screen_capture_in_loop` is true, orientation now includes a screenshot-based desktop observation summary generated via vision evaluation before prompt synthesis. Orientation captures are written to `.ponderer/orientation_latest.png` under the launch/working directory.
- Repeated orientation screenshot-capture failures are warn-once + debug thereafter to avoid log spam; macOS permission failures include a Screen Recording hint.
- Journal generation now runs off orientation disposition (`journal`) with two anti-spam guards: skip when disposition is unchanged from previous cycle, and skip until a minimum interval elapses since the last entry.
- Tool access is now enforced by explicit capability profiles per loop (`private_chat`, `skill_events`, `heartbeat`), with optional config overrides for allow/deny lists.
- Operator messages and per-turn agent outcomes now append to daily memory log keys (`activity-log-YYYY-MM-DD`) for longitudinal context.
- Heartbeat mode is guarded by config + due-time checks and is intentionally quiet when no pending tasks/reminders are found.
- Memory evolution scheduling is heartbeat-triggered but independently rate-limited by its own interval key in `agent_state`.
- The run loop is intentionally conservative around errors: failures emit events and continue after short backoff.
