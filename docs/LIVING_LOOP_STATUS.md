# Living Loop Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-15

---

## Current State

Living Loop phases 1-5 are now implemented.

- Default mode remains backward compatible (`enable_ambient_loop = false`): legacy single-loop execution path is preserved.
- Phase-5 mode is opt-in (`enable_ambient_loop = true`): explicit three-loop architecture (Engaged/Ambient/Dream) is active.

### Runtime Shape (Phase-5 mode enabled)

```text
run_loop:
  check_pause()
  maybe_evolve_persona()
  run_engaged_tick()      # operator chat + skill events
  run_ambient_tick()      # orientation + disposition + heartbeat merge
  if should_dream():
    run_dream_cycle()
  sleep(calculate_tick_duration())
```

## Completed Work

| Phase | Bead | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | `Ponderer-a1q` | ✅ Closed | Presence/journal/concern/orientation tables + types + DB APIs |
| Phase 2: Presence & Orientation | `Ponderer-8v9` | ✅ Closed | Real sampling, orientation engine, signature fast-path, orientation event logging |
| Phase 3: Journal System | `Ponderer-p0w` | ✅ Closed | Journal engine, disposition wiring, anti-spam gating, persistence, journal event |
| Phase 4: Concerns System | `Ponderer-8l7` | ✅ Closed | Concern ingest/touch/decay/prioritized retrieval context + concern events |
| Phase 5: Three-loop Architecture | `Ponderer-0jj` | ✅ Closed | Engaged/Ambient/Dream loops, adaptive ticks, dream triggering/cycle, ambient+dream capability profiles |

### Companion Overhaul Milestones (`Ponderer-cpf` subtree)

| Milestone | Bead | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------|------|
| ALMA-lite foundation | `Ponderer-cpf.1` | ✅ Closed | Memory evolution architecture baseline (later re-scoped to pragmatic scope) |
| Versioned memory backend | `Ponderer-cpf.1.1` | ✅ Closed | Memory backend interface + migration registry |
| Memory evaluation harness | `Ponderer-cpf.1.2` | ✅ Closed | Replay/scoring harness for memory backend comparison |
| Archive + promotion policy | `Ponderer-cpf.1.3` | ✅ Closed | Governance rules for candidate memory upgrades |
| Periodic evolution runner | `Ponderer-cpf.1.4` | ✅ Closed | Scheduled evolution path (heartbeat-compatible) |
| Candidate backend shadow eval | `Ponderer-cpf.1.5` | ✅ Closed | Episodic/FTS candidate evaluation scaffolding |
| ComfyUI media tooling | `Ponderer-cpf.2` | ✅ Closed | Media generation plumbing for chat and Graphchan workflows |
| Turn-control + live activity | `Ponderer-cpf.3` | ✅ Closed | Structured multi-step turn loop + live progress visibility |
| Parser hardening | `Ponderer-cpf.4` | ✅ Closed | Guardrails against hallucinated user-turn parsing |
| Vision and screenshot tools | `Ponderer-cpf.5` | ✅ Closed | Optional visual tooling and screenshot capability |
| Capability profile split | `Ponderer-cpf.6` | ✅ Closed | Separate capability profiles for private vs external turns |
| Session compaction | `Ponderer-cpf.7` | ✅ Closed | Long-session summarization/snapshot support |

### Key Delivered Capabilities

- Orientation updates each cycle with persistence and UI telemetry.
- Ambient journaling with disposition gating and rate limiting.
- Concern lifecycle: create/touch/reactivate/decay (`7d -> monitoring`, `30d -> background`, `90d -> dormant`).
- Concern-priority context feeding retrieval/prompt assembly.
- Optional dream cycle with interval gating + consolidation hooks.
- Feature-flagged three-loop architecture with legacy-path compatibility.

### Validation Baseline

- `cargo fmt` passing.
- `cargo test -q` passing (`141` tests at latest phase-5 checkpoint).

## Remaining Work

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Living Loop parent feature (`Ponderer-141`) | 🟡 Open | Final integration and acceptance pass for LL feature umbrella |
| Companion epic parent (`Ponderer-cpf`) | 🟡 Open | Parent tracking issue; most major sub-beads are now complete |
| Background subtask runner (`Ponderer-cpf.8`) | 🟡 Open | Next concrete implementation item in ready queue |
| Phase 6: ALMA meta-agent (`Ponderer-xj6`) | 🟡 Open (stretch) | Deferred/re-scoped; full autonomous self-codegen is currently out of scope |

## Notes

- This status supersedes the earlier "not started" phase checklist.
- Bead IDs in this document reflect current tracker state (including completed `cpf.*` items).
- Immediate next ready implementation item is `Ponderer-cpf.8`, with `Ponderer-141` and `Ponderer-cpf` remaining as umbrella issues.
